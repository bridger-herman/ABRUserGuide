# Known bugs

## New layers don't show up
Sometimes, new layers don't show up when you put key data on them. First, try moving the layer around the composition workspace a few times. If it still doesn't show up, save your state, then hit the state refresh button. If this still doesn't work, try deleting the layer and recreating it.

## (some change I made) doesn't update the visualization
Occasionally, the visualization may not update when you make a change in the design interface, such as updating a colormap or scalar remapping. To force an update of the visualization, go to the composition panel and move one of the layers by a small amount.
